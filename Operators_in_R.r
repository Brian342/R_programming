# Arithmetic Operators
# Relational Operators
# Logical Operators

# Arithmetic operator
x = 10 # nolint: assignment_linter.
y <- 20 # variable y is assigned value 20
30 -> z # nolint.  assined 30 to variable z

# print(x)

# Arithmetic operators are used to
# perform basic mathematical operations
# like addition (+), subtraction(-), multiplication(*), division(/) etc.

x * y

# Relational Operators are used to test/ define a relationship
# between two operands
# <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=
x<y
