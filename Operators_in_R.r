# Assignment Operators - used to assign a value to an object <-, -> =
# Arithmetic Operators
# Relational Operators
# Logical Operators

# Arithmetic operator
x = 10 # nolint: assignment_linter.
y <- 20 # variable y is assigned value 20
30 -> z # nolint.  assined 30 to variable z

# print(x)

# Arithmetic operators are used to
# perform basic mathematical operations
# like addition (+), subtraction(-), multiplication(*), division(/) etc.

# x * y

# Relational Operators are used to test/ define a relationship
# between two operands
# <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=
# x < y 

# Logical Operators are used to make a decision 
# on the basic of a condition
# & - and operator = Returns TRUE if both the 
# conditions are true, else return FALSE eg 10 > 20 & 10 < 20
# | or operator = Returns True if any one of the conditions results in TRUE
# 10 > 20 | 10 < 20 TRUE
# NOT ! = Takes each element of the vector and gives the opposite logical value !(10 == 3) TRUE
