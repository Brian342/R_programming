# Every data in R is an object
# Types of Objects are vector, list, matrix, Array, Factor, DataFrame
# Vector is a linear which contains homogenous elements eg c(1,2,3), c(TRUE, FALSE)
my_vector <- c(1,2,3)

# List - is a linear object which contains heterogenous elements
# list(101, "sparta")

# Matrix is a 2-D object which contains homogenous elements or elements of similar type
# matrix(c(1:8))
